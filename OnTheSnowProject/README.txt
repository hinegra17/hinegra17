I recommend checking out the OnTheSnowSQL.ipynb first. It introduces the project, presents preprocessing and queries I performed on the data in an easy-to-follow way, and gives links to the other contents of this folder when necessary (like the scraping and Tableau components).

That being said, here is what you can find in each of these files and folders:
“CSV files after scraping” contains the files produced from the process of scraping OnTheSnow.com.
“SQL code and outputs” exists for anyone who wants to see screenshots of what I did in Microsoft SQL Server for this project and the .sql file containing that code.
“OnTheSnowSQL.ipynb” (RECOMMENDED) contains a notebook of a more formal writeup of this project, including all of the queries from the “SQL code and outputs” folder in one file, some visualizations of those queries, and links to the other parts of the project within the notebook.
“SnowReportScraping.ipynb” contains the code I used to scrape and collect the data for this project.
